<h1>Apple : <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple">Apple</a></h1>
<hr>
<p>An apple is the round, edible fruit of an apple tree (Malus spp.). Fruit trees of the orchard or domestic apple (Malus domestica), the most widely grown in the genus, are cultivated worldwide. The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found. Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Eurasia before they were introduced to North America by European colonists. Apples have cultural significance in many mythologies (including Norse and Greek) and religions (such as Christianity in Europe).</p>
<h2>Ethymology</h2>
<hr>
<p>The word apple is derived from Old English Ã¦ppel, meaning "fruit", not specifically the apple. That in turn is descended from the Proto-Germanic noun *aplaz, descended in turn from Proto-Indo-European .As late as the 17th century, the word also functioned as a generic term for all fruit, including nuts. This can be compared to the 14th-century Middle English expression appel of paradis, meaning a banana.</p>
<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>The apple as a species has more than 100 alternative scientific names, or synonyms.[18] In modern times, Malus pumila and Malus domestica are the two main names in use. M. pumila is the older name, but M. domestica has become much more commonly used starting in the 21st century, especially in the western world. Two proposals were made to make M. domestica a conserved name: the earlier proposal was voted down by the Committee for Vascular Plants of the IAPT in 2014, but in April 2017 the Committee decided, with a narrow majority, that the newly popular name should be conserved.[19] The General Committee of the IAPT decided in June 2017 to approve this change, officially conserving M. domestica.[20] Nevertheless, some works published after 2017 still use M. pumila as the correct name, under an alternate taxonomy</p>

<h3>Genome</h3>
<hr>
<section>Apples are diploid, with two sets of chromosomes per cell (though triploid cultivars, with three sets, are not uncommon), have 17 chromosomes and an estimated genome size of approximately 650 Mb. Several whole genome sequences have been completed and made available. The first one in 2010 was based on the diploid cultivar 'Golden Delicious'.[21] However, this first whole genome sequence contained several errors,[22] in part owing to the high degree of heterozygosity in diploid apples which, in combination with an ancient genome duplication, complicated the assembly. Recently, double- and trihaploid individuals have been sequenced, yielding whole genome sequences of higher quality.</section>
<br>
<section>The first whole genome assembly was estimated to contain around 57,000 genes,[21] though the more recent genome sequences support estimates between 42,000 and 44,700 protein-coding genes.[23][24] The availability of whole genome sequences has provided evidence that the wild ancestor of the cultivated apple most likely is Malus sieversii. Re-sequencing of multiple accessions has supported this, while also suggesting extensive introgression from Malus sylvestris following domestication.[25]</section>
